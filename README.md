##  Design

###  Design Choices


-   Since Tavern is located on a sea coast, I added a lot of blue to the website.
-   I tried to show how easy, calm, and relaxed the experience at Rhodes Restaurant is.
-   I made the page simple for the user, so the user could take action by contacting the restaurant to book a table.

###  Fonts

During the design development, I used the following list of fonts: Lato, Oswald, sans-serif, Arial.

<br>

-   I use Lato as the default font for the **body** on all pages.
-   Oswald is used for the logo.
-   Arial font was used for **h2**, **p**, and **body** of the booking page.
 Sans-serif is used as a backup.


###  Structure

The page is structured in a well know, recognizable, user friendly, and easy to learn way. Upon arriving to the website the user sees a familiar type of navigation bar with the restaurant logo on the left side and the navigation links to the right.

The website consists of five separate pages:

- A homepage with a sections for News and Sunday Meal Offers

- An about page with the About Us and Meet the Chef

- A menu page

- A image gallery with images and video showcasing the general feel of the restaurant

- A contact page with a contact form, a map and information about the bussines section

##  Validation

###  HTML Validation

We utilized the W3C Markup Validation Service to validate the HTML of our website. The Home and Menu pages passed without errors; however, the Gallery and Contact pages returned warnings and errors. Based on my assessment, I deem these errors to be false positives. I have added comments to each section to provide justification for my conclusion.

<details><summary>Home</summary>

<img src="docs/validation/home_page_validation.png">

</details>


<details><summary>Menu</summary>

<img src="docs/validation/menu-page-validation.png">

</details>

<details><summary>Gallery</summary>

An error was detected on the 'Gallery' page, which has been attributed to the methodology utilized by the lecturer in the CodeInstitute example. Despite the warning, we have opted to retain the existing structure, and therefore, we will not convert the section to a div

<img src="docs/validation/gallery_page_validation.png">

</details>

<details><summary>Contact</summary>
Two errors have been identified on this page; however, after thorough investigation, we believe that both are false positives. It is not feasible to modify the '100%' value to '100' as it would cause page breakage. Additionally, the use of 'px' in height is an acceptable CSS method, as outlined by the W3C CSS specification (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/height). Consequently, we have made a decision to disregard these errors and consider them as false positives.

<img src="docs/validation/contact-page-validation.png">

</details>

###  CSS Validation

The CSS of the website was validated using the W3C Jigsaw CSS Validation Service, which yielded no errors.

<details><summary>whole page</summary>

CSS Home page validation: No Errors

CSS Contact page validation: No Errors

</details>

<details><summary>style.css</summary>

Upon examination, no CSS errors were detected in the CSS.style document.

<img src="docs/validation/css-style-validation.png">

</details>

###  Accessibility

The WAVE WebAIM web accessibility evaluation tool was used to ensure the website met high accessibility standards.

<details><summary>Home</summary>

On this page, we have identified 5 errors and 1 alert. 

The first error is "Empty Form Label." However, this is a false positive error since the form is not visible to the user. The form is actually added to create a hamburger menu. Therefore, "Empty Form Label" is a false positive error.

We have also identified 4 "Contrast Errors," but the content of the site navigation bar is actually quite visible. For this reason, these errors are also false positives.

Finally, we have identified 1 "Redundancy Link" alert. This is because the logo of the page and the home page have exactly the same hyperlink. However, this is part of the initial website design, so it is also a false positive error.

<img src="docs/accessibility/home-accessibility-test.png">
</details>

<details><summary>Menu</summary>

We have identified the presence of similar errors on the Menu page as those found on the Home page. As a result, we recommend accessing the Home Accessibility section to review any notes or information pertaining to these errors

<img src="docs/accessibility/menu-accessibility-test.png">

</details>


<details><summary>Gallery</summary>

We have identified the presence of similar errors on the Gallery page as those found on the Home page. As a result, we recommend accessing the Home Accessibility section to review any notes or information pertaining to these errors

<img src="docs/accessibility/gallery-accessibility-test.png">

</details>


<details><summary>Contact</summary>

While reviewing this particular page, we have identified a newly surfaced error that was not present on the Home, Menu, or Gallery pages. Specifically, there appears to be a 'Contrast Error' that pertains to the 'Submit' button located within the Contact Form.

 It should be noted, however, that upon further examination, this appears to be a false positive as the button and accompanying text are clearly visible.

##  Validation

###  HTML Validation

We utilized the W3C Markup Validation Service to validate the HTML of our website. The Home and Menu pages passed without errors; however, the Gallery and Contact pages returned warnings and errors. Based on my assessment, I deem these errors to be false positives. I have added comments to each section to provide justification for my conclusion.

<details><summary>Home</summary>

<img src="docs/validation/home_page_validation.png">

</details>


<details><summary>Menu</summary>

<img src="docs/validation/menu-page-validation.png">

</details>

<details><summary>Gallery</summary>

An error was detected on the 'Gallery' page, which has been attributed to the methodology utilized by the lecturer in the CodeInstitute example. Despite the warning, we have opted to retain the existing structure, and therefore, we will not convert the section to a div

<img src="docs/validation/gallery_page_validation.png">

</details>

<details><summary>Contact</summary>
Two errors have been identified on this page; however, after thorough investigation, we believe that both are false positives. It is not feasible to modify the '100%' value to '100' as it would cause page breakage. Additionally, the use of 'px' in height is an acceptable CSS method, as outlined by the W3C CSS specification (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/height). Consequently, we have made a decision to disregard these errors and consider them as false positives.

###  CSS Validation

The CSS of the website was validated using the W3C Jigsaw CSS Validation Service, which yielded no errors.

<details><summary>style.css</summary>

Upon examination, no CSS errors were detected in the CSS.style document.

</details>

###  Accessibility

The WAVE WebAIM web accessibility evaluation tool was used to ensure the website met high accessibility standards.

<details><summary>Home</summary>

On this page, we have identified 5 errors and 1 alert. 

The first error is "Empty Form Label." However, this is a false positive error since the form is not visible to the user. The form is actually added to create a hamburger menu. Therefore, "Empty Form Label" is a false positive error.

We have also identified 4 "Contrast Errors," but the content of the site navigation bar is actually quite visible. For this reason, these errors are also false positives.

Finally, we have identified 1 "Redundancy Link" alert. This is because the logo of the page and the home page have exactly the same hyperlink. However, this is part of the initial website design, so it is also a false positive error.

<img src="docs/accessibility/home-accessibility-test.png">
</details>

<details><summary>Menu</summary>

We have identified the presence of similar errors on the Menu page as those found on the Home page. As a result, we recommend accessing the Home Accessibility section to review any notes or information pertaining to these errors

<img src="docs/accessibility/menu-accessibility-test.png">

</details>


<details><summary>Gallery</summary>

We have identified the presence of similar errors on the Gallery page as those found on the Home page. As a result, we recommend accessing the Home Accessibility section to review any notes or information pertaining to these errors

<img src="docs/accessibility/gallery-accessibility-test.png">

</details>


<details><summary>Contact</summary>

While reviewing this particular page, we have identified a newly surfaced error that was not present on the Home, Menu, or Gallery pages. Specifically, there appears to be a 'Contrast Error' that pertains to the 'Submit' button located within the Contact Form.

 It should be noted, however, that upon further examination, this appears to be a false positive as the button and accompanying text are clearly visible.
